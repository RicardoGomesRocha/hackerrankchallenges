# HackerRank problem-solving solutions

This project will hold [HankerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) rank solutions. Hanker rank is a nice place to practice __problem-solving capabilities in order to maintain my mind sharp__.

A more formal definition for what HackerRank is:

> HackerRank is a place where programmers from all over the world come together to solve problems in a wide range of Computer Science domains such as algorithms, machine learning, or artificial intelligence, as well as to practice different programming paradigms like functional programming.

## Folder Structure

For each problem and respective solution, there is one  folder containing the solution for a specific HarckerRank problem, were:

- `README.md` file exposing the problem and explaining how to run the application as well a link to the HackerRank problem;
- `index.js` file containing the solution;
- `index.spec.js` file containing a suit of tests in order to verify the solution.
