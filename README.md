# HackerRank problem-solving solutions ‚úÖ

This project contains a set of [HankerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) solutions. Hanker rank is a nice place to practice __problem-solving capabilities, maintaining my mind sharp__.

A more formal definition for what HackerRank is:

> HackerRank is a place where programmers from all over the world come together to solve problems in a wide range of Computer Science domains such as algorithms, machine learning, or artificial intelligence, as well as to practice different programming paradigms like functional programming.

## üìÅ Folder Structure

For each problem and respective solution, there is one  folder containing the solution for a specific HackerRank problem, were:

- `README.md` file describes the problem and explains how to run the application. Also, provides a link to the HackerRank problem;
- `index.js` file containing the solution code;
- `index.spec.js` file containing a suit of tests in order to verify the solution codified.
